# Usage

Read the guide on how to install and run tests.

```bash
git clone git@github.com:unioslo/pg-iam.git
cd pg-iam
./install.sh --guide
```

# Container

In this repository there is an extension of the
[docker.io/postgres](https://hub.docker.com/_/postgres) image provided for
running pg-iam in a container.

> [!WARNING]
>
> pg-iam will only be installed by this container when started with an
> **empty PostgreSQL data directory** during the first-time run.

## Running the container

An example invocation, setting superuser password to `mypassword` while making
PostgreSQL reachable for local connections on TCP port 5432:

```console
docker run --rm \
    --env POSTGRES_PASSWORD=mypassword \
    -p 127.0.0.1:5432:5432 \
    ghcr.io/unioslo/pg-iam:2.9
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> The `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` environment variable can be set to anything, but *some*
> value is required to start the container image. This will be used as the
> superuser's password.

For persisting data, you will need to mount a volume for the container's
PostgreSQL data directory:

```console
docker run --rm \
    --env POSTGRES_PASSWORD=anotherpassword \
    -v /custom/mount:/var/lib/postgresql/data \
    -p 127.0.0.1:5432:5432 \
    ghcr.io/unioslo/pg-iam:2.5
```

> [!TIP]
> To review all available options, please refer to the [`docker.io/postgres`
> images' documentation](https://github.com/docker-library/docs/blob/master/postgres/README.md).
